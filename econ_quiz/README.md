#Econ Quiz - How many global economics facts do you know?

This project aims to create a fun quiz web application for anyone and everyone interested in global economics-related data. There are many web and mobile applications that focus on the quizzing experience regarding topics such as pop culture, geography, history, music, movies and literature. Some also offer a fun experience to test one's knowledge in subjects such as mathematics, chemistry and biology. There does not seem to be any application that allows users to properly test their knowledge regarding topics such as GDP, or population or various nations. Econ Quiz comes to fill that gap.
